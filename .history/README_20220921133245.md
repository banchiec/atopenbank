# Welcome to the Openbank test

The test consists of designing, laying out and developing a small wizard from scratch that simulates something as typical as creating a password for a user. What we want you to do is to propose a wizard of about 3 steps in which a user receives information that he is about to create a new password, a form where he is asked for a series of data to create the password and a final operation feedback page.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Step 1`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
