# Welcome to the Openbank test

The test consists of designing, laying out and developing a small wizard from scratch that simulates something as typical as creating a password for a user. What we want you to do is to propose a wizard of about 3 steps in which a user receives information that he is about to create a new password, a form where he is asked for a series of data to create the password and a final operation feedback page.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Step 1 Password information screen`

On this screen, the user who enters the application must understand that she is hiring. You must welcome the product "Open Close Current Account" and explain that you will require their data in the following steps. It is a screen with explanation, product name and wizard buttons to advance

### `Step `

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
